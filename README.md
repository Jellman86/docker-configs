# docker-configs
My personal docker compose files. I have recently updated them to be totally compatible with the docker implementation on Trunas Sale Electric Eel. 

Some of the compose files requite an .env file with the hidden variables in them to work. More information on how to implement this can be found [here.](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/environment-variables/set-environment-variables/)
